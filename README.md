## About the book

Welcome to your big-picture guide to the React ecosystem.

If you're new to React and looking to become a professional React developer, this book is for you. This updated sixth edition reflects the current state of React 19, including the latest hooks, server-side rendering with Next.js 15, and React Native with Expo.

Part 1 introduces you to React. You'll discover JSX syntax, hooks, functional components, and event handling, learn techniques to fetch data from a server, and tackle the tricky problem of state management. Once you're comfortable with writing React in JavaScript, you'll pick up TypeScript development in later chapters.

Part 2 transitions you into React Native for mobile development. React Native goes hand-in-hand with React. With your React knowledge behind you, you'll appreciate where and how React Native differs as you write shared components for Android and iOS apps. You'll learn how to build responsive layouts, use animations, and implement geolocation.

By the end of this book, you'll have a big-picture view of React and React Native and be able to build applications with both.

## Key Takeaways

## Software and hardware list

This book assumes you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript programming language. It also assumes that you'll be following along with the examples, which require a command-line terminal, a code editor, and a web browser. You'll learn how to set up a React project in Chapter 1, Why React?.

The requirements for learning React Native are the same as for React development, but to run an app on a real device, you will need an Android or iOS smartphone. In order to run iOS apps in the simulator, you will need a Mac computer. To work with Android simulator, you can use any kind of PC.
